  <h2>Pat's Salmon Cookies, the PNW's original fish cookie!</h2>
  <p id="story">Pat was just a cat, a cat with a dream to make a savory fish cookie that would be enjoyed by all, cat and human alike. Pat searched the globe for the perrrfect location when he was tragically caught between a tourist and one of Pikes Places fish throwers. He suffered a concussion and spent several days at the vet. Tragedy turned to triumph Pat won a class A' lawsuit against the fish throwers which included a contract to provide pat a steadily supply of the freshest fish in Seattle for his cookies.</p>

<p id="story2">After earning a dual degree in business development and astrophysics from UW pat opened his first coffee shop 2 months ago, since then Pat's business has grown rapidly and he has opened several locations all-over the greater Seattle area.  </p>
